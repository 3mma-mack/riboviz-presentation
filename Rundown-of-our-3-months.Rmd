### TODO Change title of this bit

**Staff** at the [Wallace Lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), TODO from WHEN TO WHEN

* _some_
* **bullet** 
* points
</div>


## Outline: 

* where we started
* added documentation 
* upgraded configs 
* added new dataset
* updated file names 
* created meta features scripts 
* what we learnt

## Where we started:

## Overview of end of honours project

## Upgraded configs 

* Updated configuration yamls in example-datasets by running riboviz.tools.upgrade_config_file 

## Added documentation

* Add-new-dataset.md in riboviz/example-datasets 
    - Documentation of steps involved in adding new species and new datasets to the riboviz/example-datasets repository 

* A template with checklist for adding a new dataset
    - Checklist template you can select when creating an issue ticket for the addition of a new species and/or a new dataset

## Added new dataset 

* Why _Histoplasma capsulatum_: fungal pathogen, commonly observed in immunocompromised patients 

* Followed documentation in Add-new-dataset.md to test its usability 
* Added the new species _H. capsulatum_ to example-datasets
   - Assembled and tested annotation and contamination files for the species 
* Added a new dataset for _H. capsulatum_ from Anita Sil’s lab

## Outputs of new dataset, things to look out for in future

* Potentially due to poor annotation, a noncoding sequence is slipping into the final results. Overall there is good periodicity, so potential to analyse in the future

TO DO: add figure

## Updated file names 

To meet reviewers feedback, some of the confusing names had to be addressed. Pretty tedious work, as numerous files but I got my way through it.

## Article writing 

* Open science as an undergraduate. 
* look over and evaluate our time with the lab, gain a publication
* Practice writing

## Created metafeature scripts

## Codon pairs - why, how does it work?

## Single codons - why, how does it work?

## Nucleotides - why, how does it work?

## Recreating data from Gamble et al. 2016

## Comparing inhibitory and optimised codon pairs 

## Next steps

## What we learnt

* Collaboration - prioritization of tasks that aid the team
* Communication – better updates on Github and clearer comments in code
* Insights into the process of writing papers
* Insights into software development and maintenance 
* Greatly improved the quality of code we write


## Thanks to everyone in the lab!
